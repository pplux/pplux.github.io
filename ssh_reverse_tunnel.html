===============================================================================
An script to create a reverse tunnel to connect to a linux machine through a 
jumpbox server. First, you have to configure a passwordless SSH connection.

passwordless ssh login
---------------------------

On the client create a ssh key with ssh-keygen, do not enter any password:
```bash
~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/user/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:o8GGK+zMJFff42GzD7T2r9HPt7ICOaC4eKocX9S2XVQ user@ClientMachine
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|             A   |
|            .    |
|           .     |
|     oo   .      |
|   .oo=+S. .     |
| ..oo=.+*o.      |
|.o=.o.@..+.      |
|oB=..+ B ..o. .  |
|+++.  o.+o..++.. |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Copy `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the jumbpox server and edit `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
cat path_to_id_rsa/id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
```

You should now be able to login into the jumbpox server without password from the client
machine.

sshd config
------------
On the jumpbox server, configure sshd (etc/ssh/sshd_config) to keep the connection
alive:

```
   TCPKeepAlive yes
   ClientAliveInterval 60
```

client config
-------------
On the client configure crontab to keep trying to connect to the server.
```
crontab -e
```
add
```crontab
*/1 * * * * ~/create_ssh_tunnel.sh > tunnel.log 2>&1
```

Client must have ssh running, but it can listen only to 127.0.0.1, that way you will prevent login
from anywhere but the jumbpox server.


Code
===============================================================================
This is the script that will try to connect to he jumpbox server, change the path and
name accordingly to your crontab config.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PORT=$((22200+1))
SERVER=backdoor@fakeserver.com


createTunnel() {
  /usr/bin/ssh -oExitOnForwardFailure=yes -N -R $PORT:localhost:22 $SERVER
  if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo Tunnel to $SERVER created successfully
  else
    echo An error occurred creating a tunnel to $SERVER
  fi
}

/bin/pidof ssh
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo Creating new tunnel connection
  createTunnel
fi
```

The script must have the execution bit set ``chmod 700 tunnel.sh`` for the crontab to be able to 
run it.

Connecting to the client from the jumpbox server
================================================

To connect back to the client from the jumpbox server, log in first to
the server and then log in to the client as shown

```
ssh user@localhost -p 22201
```

If you're planning to use this with several client machines, remember to assign a unique local port to each one.
